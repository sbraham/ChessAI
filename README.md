# ChessAI
Gilgamesh Blue

this if my first actual attempt of creating a machine learning algorithem (done half way through Project Gilgamesh)
Evolutional Nural Net learning how to play chess

Currently - the chess part works, although the AI is still in development (need to change the fitness calculation and the learning environment)
